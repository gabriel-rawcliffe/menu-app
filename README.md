# Recipe-app (need an name)

Project outline:

I want to build on the skeleton built during group project one "Hells-Kitchen" that was a simple way to post recipes into a site and see available recipes.

I want the final product to have some added features:
  1. Recipes seperated by categories
  2. Can search recipes by keyword, or by submitting specific ingredients, and only recipes including those ingredients are returned
  3. Add cooking details, prep time cook time, total time
  4. Add "quick meal" option that returns only meals under a certain total time
  5. Add a review option
  6. Add personal accounts with favourites, and linked to reviews, and submitted recipes.
  7. Random recipe option?
